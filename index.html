        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Priscilla Ayala, and I am a third year student at the University of California Riverside. I am majoring in political science in hopes to pursue law school in the near future. My long-term goal is to become an attorney and specialize in either family law or immigration. I have a passion for learning about law and politics and I want to be able to help people who are in situations where they probably feel at their lowest.  Currently, I am working part-time as a customer experience coordinator at a retail department store in Fontana, California. I am utilizing my current job to improve my communication and social skills. I enjoy being in a leadership position where I can help others develop new skills and create an atmosphere of trust and respect.I am constantly promoting a happy work environment for my team and customers that come into the store. I enjoy watching my team excel and making others feel valued and engaged in a fast-paced environment. I love providing new ideas to the team and taking on new challenges!
<br><br>

        I am a very optimistic and enthusiastic individual that loves a challenge. I enjoy problem-solving and utilizing my critical thinking skills. Whether it is collaborating with others or working on myself, I do it all. I am very dedicated to my work and consider myself a perfectionist. If it is not done perfectly, I will not be satisfied and will re-do it until it is none other than perfect. I would definitely consider that to be one of my weaknesses. However, my strengths consist of adaptability, critical thinking skills, problem solving skills, active listening, technical skills, my persistence, being detail oriented, organizational skills, my patience, collaborative skills, determination, flexibility, and I am a fast learner. 
<br><br>

        Majority of my experience revolves around retail and customer service. I have managed to build the majority of my strong skills working in retail. Prior to working in customer service, I was very involved in high school which I feel prepared me for the leadership skills I have acquired to this day. For example, I was part of the cheerleading team which allowed me to build on my leadership. Prior to that I was an active member of the park and ocean cleanup organization in my city. I would often travel to the beaches on the west coast and participate in cleaning up plastic and other trash that harms the environment. The main beaches were Santa Monica and Huntington Beach. I would also go to the local parks near my city on the weekends and cleanup the areas. Volunteering at these events gave me a sense of feeling more connected to my community and helped me gain a sense of responsibility towards my community as well. Some of my favorite activities to do is going to museums and learning about the spanish art that is displayed. I love learning about history and studying archaeology. It simply fascinates me because I believe the past has a huge relation on our present.
